Utilite-Build--Kali-Scripts
===========================

 The first block of instructions is explicit directions for building the Kali-ARM on an Utilite mini computer.(http://utilite-computer.com/web/home)I compile this from several sources. I've been building several kali boxes and the prcoess is time consuming. These collected scripts(which I cannot take credit for) to aid in quick "ready to roll" pentest box.
